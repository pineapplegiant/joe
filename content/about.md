# Hi my name is Joe

I was born and raised in Florida and graduated at the University of South Florida with a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering.

On my spare time I love to cook, go running, and rock climb.

I also love coffee and spicy foods, although, I don't recommend mixing the two.

Let's get coffee together and chat, I love meeting new people :)
